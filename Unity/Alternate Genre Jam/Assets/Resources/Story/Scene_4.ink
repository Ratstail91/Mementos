// === Scene_4 ===

// ~ temp photograph = GetVariable("photograph")

// ~SetBackground("home_1", 3)

// You're standing in front of your house. {photograph == "true":It's almost like a photograph.}

// Not much has changed here. It's almost a joke, how similar this place is to when you left it, like the world didn't change, like lives didn't end.

// Like your life didn't end.

// It doesn't feel the same though. It's not home anymore. Nowhere is home anymore.
